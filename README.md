# 📊 Product Sales & Profit Analysis Dashboard – 15 Days Summer Internship 2025

This project was developed during my **15-day Summer Internship (2025)**.  
It involves analyzing product sales and profit data using **Power BI** and **Python** for preprocessing.  

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Designed **two interactive Power BI dashboards**:
  - **Sales Dashboard** – Showcasing city-wise sales, category performance, and trends.
  - **Profit Dashboard** – Highlighting profit distribution, category-wise profit, and regional insights.
- Implemented **filters, region buttons, and navigation** for interactivity.
- Processed raw data using **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** before visualization.

## 🗂️ Files in Repository
- `Data-preprocessing.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning & preprocessing  
- `Product Sales & Profit Analysis Dashboard.pbix` → Power BI dashboard file  
- `SalesDataset.csv` → Raw dataset used for analysis  
- `README.md` → Project documentation  

## 📌 Key Insights
- City-wise sales & profit distribution  
- Category-wise performance comparison  
- Profit trend analysis across different regions  
- Clear and interactive visuals for business decision-making  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** → Data preprocessing (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
